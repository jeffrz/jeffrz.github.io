  <h3>Notes for September 6</h3>
  <p>
  	<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> is a library that makes it easy to create and manipulate page elements. It's not restricted to SVG elements, but that's what we'll usually use it for. We'll start by using d3 to select DOM elements, create new elements, and modify the content and appearance of elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can find a bunch of D3 examples <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery">here</a> and access <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md">D3's online API reference</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today we will be looking at <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale">d3 scales</a>. Here is a helpful diagram for how scaleLinear works:

  // --- 1. Let's make a histogram of all passengers on the Titanic
  //  This will take the form of a bar chart -- but we are using a trick and not creating <rect> for each bar
  //  Instead, we'll make a thick vertical <line> for each bar. I don't recommend you do this outside of toy examples


  // First two linear scales, age -> x-pixels, lived -> y-pixels

  // Think of "domain" and "range" as "input" and "output",
  //  NOT as x and y.

  // The domain takes a single argument, an array (NOT two arguments), which represents two inputs. 
  // The range works the same way: we give it a two-element array.
  
  // scaleLinear does what is called a linear interpolation (or "lerp")
  // Behind the scenes, scaleLinear first does (value - domainMin) / (domainMax - domainMin) to get a 
  //  0 to 1 value, then it multiplies the result using: (result * (rangeMax - rangeMin)) + rangeMin
  // We often choose domain min and max to be reasonable extremes, but the function will still work for
  //  values outside these values because the domain does not "clamp", or restrict values to the min and 
  //  the max -- this can lead to unexpected results where points go beyond the range min and max.


  let svg = d3.select("svg#all");
  console.log(svg);
  let width = svg.attr("width");
  let height = svg.attr("height");


  let ageScale = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([0,80]) // From our data
    .range([10,width-10]); // We want to space things inwards a bit
  // d3.scaleLinear() returns a FUNCTION which we then assign to ageScale (because functions are also objects in JS). This allows us to call ageScale(number)

  
    let maxMortality = d3.max( passengers, d => Math.max( d.lived, d.died ) );
    console.log(maxMortality);

  let livedScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                     //.domain([0,200]) // We started by picking an arbitrary max number by guess
                     .domain([0,maxMortality]) // At the end of class we noticed this was a bad idea
                     .range([height/2.0, 10]); 
                       // For range we're using a trick -- because the SVG coord system is "upside-down", we can configure the
                       //  scale in reverse (i.e. [max, min] instead of [min, max]) so that it "does the math" for us!
                      
  // Try modifying .domain() or .range() so that it doesn't have the brackets
  // It will fail silently -- the function will just start returning NaN
  // If you ever see unexpected NaNs or undefineds creeping in, check your scales first! The brackets are easy to forget

  // Now let's draw some lines!
  passengers.forEach( (d, i) => {
    svg.append("line")

      .style("stroke-width", 10);
      
      // NOTE: In class I added the ---2 elements right here. For clarity, I've moved them downwards to the next section.
  });


  // --- 2. What about deaths? (oop, things are getting pretty dark)
  //  We can make a double histogram for this!
  //  (we set the domain at 150, died overflowed -- we need to find max!)
  // We found it here, then pasted the code to the top and used it in our scales

  let diedScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                    //.domain([0,200]) // We started by picking an arbitrary max number by guess
                    .domain([0, maxMortality]) // Bad idea to hardcode these
                    .range([height/2.0, height-10]); // Let's start in the middle

  passengers.forEach( (d, i) => {
    svg.append("line")
      .attr("x1",ageScale( d['age'] ))
      .attr("x2",ageScale( d['age'] ))

      .style("stroke-width", 10);
  });
  
  // We had a problem here where the hardcoded [0,150] domain was too small
  // How do we handle the issue with the hardcoded domains?
  //  hint: check out d3.min, d3.max, and d3.extent in the API docs
    

  // --- 3. BONUS CONTENT: Let's break the data down by gender now!
  
  // One thing we'll do often is make some new data by looping through our dataset
  // Here we'll construct a % survived metric for each age band
  passengersMale.forEach(  d => {
    // We initially just had this
    // d.percentSurvived = d.lived / (d.lived + d.died);
    // But when we got to the female dataset we had columns with 0 lived & 0 died, which threw NaN 
    //  because we were trying to divide by 0. This makes the scales angry and they return null if we leave as-is
    if ((d.lived + d.died) < 1) {
      d.percentSurvived = 0;
    }
    else {
      d.percentSurvived = d.lived / (d.lived + d.died);
    }
  }); 
  passengersFemale.forEach(  d => {
    if ((d.lived + d.died) < 1) {
      d.percentSurvived = 0;

    else {
      d.percentSurvived = d.lived / (d.lived + d.died);
    }
  }); 
  console.log(passengersMale)
  console.log(passengersFemale)

  // We first put in let by mistake -- IT WILL CAUSE EXCEPTION BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY DECLARED THE VARIABLE
  svg = d3.select("svg#male");
  console.log(svg)
  width = svg.attr("width");
  height = svg.attr("height");

  svg.append("text").text("Male Passengers").attr("x",10).attr("y",20).style("font-size","15px");


  // Let's make some new scales for this
  // We can't re-use ageScale, because we have a different width
  ageScale = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([0,80])
    .range([10,width-10]);
  percentScale = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([0,1])  // We manually set this since we want 0 to 100%
    .range([height - 10,30]); 
  
  // Let's also make a fun color scale
  let colorScale = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([0,1])
    .range(['navy','turquoise'])   // d3 will figure out that you mean colors by this
                                   //  the d3-interpolate module handles all of this using heuristics!
    .interpolate(d3.interpolateHcl);  // see lecture on Color coming up
      

  // Now make the lines
  passengersMale.forEach((d, i) => {
    svg.append("line")
      .attr("x1",ageScale( d.age ))
      .attr("x2",ageScale( d.age ))
      .attr("y1",percentScale( 0 ) + 2)  // You can tweak this with a +2 so that tiny bars show up for 0s
      .attr("y2",percentScale( d.percentSurvived ))
      .style("stroke", colorScale( d.percentSurvived ) ) // Using the color scale now too
      .style("stroke-width", 10);
    svg.append("text")
      .attr("text-anchor","middle")
      .attr("font-size","10px")
      .attr("x",ageScale(d.age))
      .attr('y',percentScale( d.percentSurvived ) - 10)
      .text(d.lived);
  });

  // Now do female side of dataset
  // We can re-use the scales since the SVG are the same size, BUT be sure to select the new SVG
  svg = d3.select("svg#female");
  console.log(svg)

  svg.append("text").text("Female Passengers").attr("x",10).attr("y",20).style("font-size","15px");
  
  passengersFemale.forEach((d, i) => {
    svg.append("line")
      .attr("x1",ageScale( d.age ))
      .attr("x2",ageScale( d.age ))
      .attr("y1",percentScale( 0 ) + 2)
      .attr("y2",percentScale( d.percentSurvived ))
      .style("stroke", colorScale( d.percentSurvived ) )
      .style("stroke-width", 10);
    svg.append("text")
      .attr("text-anchor","middle")
      .attr("font-size","10px")
      .attr("x",ageScale(d.age))
      .attr('y',percentScale( d.percentSurvived ) - 10)
      .text(d.lived);
  });
  
  // Notice that I avoided using any SCALE puns throughout the classes.
  //   Doing that was harder than scaling Mt Ranier, by my measure.
  //   It's like we're stuck on the Oregon Scale.
  //   No scalar could capture the magnitude of this challenge.
  //   I think I need an Irish Scale Ale now...
